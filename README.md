# Flatburger JavaScript Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Flatburger JavaScript Project! The webpage for this project will display a menu of food images that contains the following features:
- When hovering the mouse over a food image from the menu, its details will display below.
- Clicking on a food image from the menu will remove the food image from the menu (this feature does not persist and refreshing the page will bring the webpage back to its original state).

The webpage for this project also contains a form that can be submitted to add a new food image to the menu (this feature does not persist and refreshing the page will bring the webpage back to its original state). The new food image will maintain the same features that the other food images from the menu have.
