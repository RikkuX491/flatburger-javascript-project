# Flatburger JavaScript Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Flatburger JavaScript Project! The webpage for this project has the following features:

- Contains a menu of food images contained within `<img>` elements. Each food `<img>` element can be clicked on to display its details below.
- Contains a form (`<form>` element) that can be submitted to add a new food image to the menu (this feature does not persist and refreshing the page will bring the webpage back to its original state). The new food image will maintain the same features that the other food images from the menu have.
- Contains a dropdown menu (`<select>` element) that has options to display all of the foods or only the healthy food(s), depending on the option (`<option>` element) that is selected from the dropdown menu.
